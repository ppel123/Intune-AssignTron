## **How It Works:**

1. **Authentication**: The tool authenticates to Microsoft Graph API using the required permissions for Intune management and group data access.
  
2. **Fetch Assignment Data**: The tool queries Microsoft Graph API to retrieve assignments for the chosen resources. It handles various types of assignments including those for devices and users.

3. **Data Export**: Once the assignment data is fetched, it is displayed on the console and can be exported to CSV files for further use.

## **Installation:**

1. Install the required modules:

   ```bash
   Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Force -AllowClobber
2. Run the tool: Launch the script in PowerShell. Once executed, the script will prompt you with on-screen instructions to fetch assignments for the Intune resources. Follow the instructions to select the operation you want to perform.

## **Requirements**:

- **Microsoft Graph API Permissions**: Make sure you have the necessary permissions set up to read Intune configuration data and access group information. This typically includes permissions such as `Group.Read.All`, `DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All`, and others depending on the specific resources you're working with.

- **PowerShell**: The script is designed to run in PowerShell, so ensure that PowerShell is installed on your machine. It is compatible with both Windows and Linux environments where PowerShell is available.
